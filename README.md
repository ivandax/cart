Install dependencies with `yarn install`
Start with `yarn dev`

## Description

 - The required interface is captured in the useBasket hook (business logic).

## Considerations / Exclusions for simplicity

 - No styling tools like Prettier or Eslint
 - No routing. Can be improved by using React Router or Tanstack Router
 - No testing added
